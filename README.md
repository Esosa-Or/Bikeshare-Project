# Bikeshare-Project
A project making use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.  interactive experience in the terminal to present those statistics.

##Project Overview
This project utilizes the full power of the pandas library and simple statistical methods to carry out a descriptive analysis on bikeshare data from from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City - to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.

Running the pysthon script
Kindly input 'python bikeshare.py' on your terminal to run this script. 

Program Details
The script takes user input for the city (e.g. New York), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. February; although there is an option for 'all' option), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option). This user input interface is interactive.

Upon receiving all user input, the script prints summary descriptive statistics in detail. 

Requirements
Language: Python 3.6 or above
Libraries: pandas, numpy, time
